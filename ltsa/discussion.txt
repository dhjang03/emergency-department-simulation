Task 4 - Discussion

The original FSP model for the Emergency Department (ED) system has a deadlock problem. The deadlock
arise from an issue where a nurse who is in either Triage or Treatment attempts to acquire
orderlies to transfer the patient but there are no orderlies available to obtain because there are
nurses with orderlies awaiting entry to the Triage or Treatment. The trace from LTSA to this
problem can be found below:

Trace to DEADLOCK:
	specialist.specialistEnterTreatment
	producer.patientArriveAtED
	nurses.1.allocatePatientWithNurse
	nurses.1.acquireOrderies
	nurses.1.leaveFoyer
	nurses.1.enterTriage
	nurses.1.releaseOrderies
	nurses.1.accessSeverity
	producer.patientArriveAtED
	nurses.2.allocatePatientWithNurse
	nurses.2.acquireOrderies
	nurses.2.leaveFoyer
	producer.patientArriveAtED
	nurses.3.allocatePatientWithNurse
	nurses.3.acquireOrderies
	nurses.3.leaveFoyer
	producer.patientArriveAtED

The above trace illustrates a deadlock situation where Nurse 1 is unable to acquire orderlies because
there are not enough orderlies left to obtain as Nurse 2 and 3 acquired them and waiting to enter 
the Triage.

Before the submission for Assignment 1a, I was able to detect the deadlock although the trace to
the deadlock was different from the one illustrated above. The deadlock that was observed arose
from Producer consecutively producing severe patients. With consecutive severe patients, the nurses
deadlocked at the Treatment where the nurse in the Treatment could not acquire orderlies because other 
nurses already took the orderlies.

On the other hand, there could be a case where I was not able to detect such a deadlock. Due to a
nondeterministic behaviour of concurrent systems, the output of the system varies between each run. 
Thus, the deadlock situation I observed from Assignment 1a may not always occur in each run.

To resolve the deadlock problem, I separated the orderlies acquirement in the Foyer from orderlies
acquirement in the Triage and Treatment. When a nurse tries to acquire orderlies in the Foyer, it
will also consider the number of nurses who already left the Foyer with a patient, plus itself. It 
will acquire the orderlies if the remaining orderlies are greater or equal to "transfer orderlies * 
(number of nurses left foyer + 1)". This will ensure that at least one group of transfer orderlies 
is available for a nurse in Triage or Treatment to acquire and leave the corresponding department.

With the modified version of the system, there could be trade-offs in system performance:
    - The system now has to keep track of the number of nurses who left the Foyer and adjust orderlies
      allocation dynamically. This introduces additional complexity in orderlies management and
      introduces computational overhead to the system.
    - By ensuring that a group of orderlies is always available for nurses in Triage or Treatment, 
      the system may not utilize orderlies as efficiently as possible. This could lead to scenarios
      where orderlies are idle waiting for their next assignment, especially if the demand in the 
      Foyer is low.
